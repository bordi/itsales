= Testimonials Are Crucial to Your Success =
Social Proof is one of six principles of Influence. People are particularly susceptible to it when they’re feeling uncertain about a company or brand. When a potential customer lands on your site, how will they feel about your brand? Most website visitors don’t immediately trust a new brand. **Hence the power of a great testimonial.**

**Good Looking Testimonials equal Good Looking Sales Reports.**
Sorry, but it’s true! *Having a positive testimonial that looks ugly or out of date can end up resulting in a net gain of zero!* This is why we’ve worked hard to give you the ability to create beautiful testimonials in an instant.

A beautifully written and attractive looking testimonial from past happy customers reassures the potential customer that purchasing from your company is **the right decision** to make.

**Why We Made Handsome Testimonials by Ristretto Apps.**
Thoughtfully designed testimonials, that look good from the get-go and were easy to create, have been a struggle for many Wordpress users. Until now. Handsome Testimonials by Ristretto Apps designs are modern, sheik and very customizable, right out of the box.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display a testimonial I've created in the backend of my site? =

**Shortcode Generator**
The easy way is to use the "Insert Testimonial" button while editing a page or post in Wordpress and use the built-in shortcode generator. You must already have created a testimonial (Admin->Testimonials->Add New) before you can insert one into your site. Once you've customized your testimonial to your liking, click the "Generate Shortcode" button. Also, feel free to continue customizing your shortcode by utilizing the shortcode arguments described in this tutorial.

**Manually**
The shortcode format is as follows: [handsometestimonial id="<post id number here>"]
You can grab the specific shortcode for the testimonial you want to insert by going to the Testimonials->All Testimonials page in your Wordpress Administration area

= How do I change the displayed image size of the testimonial? =

You can designate a specific pixel size or % by using the shortcode option: img_size=""
For example: [handsometestimonial id="5" img_size="50px"]

= What are all the customizations can I make to my testimonials? =

Use the following shortcode options after inserting the standards shortcode: [handsometestimonial id="#" <--shortcode options here--> ]

* id="" - Testimonial id to display
* template="" - Choose Template
* img_shadow="" - (yes/no) Image shadow
* img_size="" - (px/%) - Size for image
* img_align="" - (left/center/right) - Set alignment for image
* img_loc="" - (before/after) - Set image before or after text
* title_color="" -  - Color of title
* title_size="" - (px/em) - Font size of title
* tst_color="" - (hex) - Color of testimonial body text
* tst_size="" - (px/em) - Font size of body text
* txt_align="" - (left/center/right) - Set alignment of all text in block
* subtitle_color="" - (hex) - Color of subtitle text
* subtitle_size="" - (px/em) - Font size of subtitle text
* subtitle_italic="" - (yes/no) - Make subtitle italic
* border="" - Choose whether to have a boder
* border_width="" - (px/em) - Border width if border is enabled
* border_color="" - (hex) - Color of boder
* bg_color="" - (hex) - Color of background
* round_corners="" - (yes/no) - Round corners
* width="" - (px/%) - Width of testimonial block
* height="" - (px/%) - Height of testimonial block
* align="" - (left/center/right) - alignment of testimonial block

Here's an example:
[handsometestimonial id="5" template="2" title_size="15px" tst_color="darkred" shadow="no" bg_color="lightblue" round_corners="yes"]

= Do I have to use shortcode to change the appearance? =

Nope! We now have a snazzy testimonial generator found on all pages and posts of your Wordpress admin area.

= What if there's something about how my testimonial that I want to change that's beyond the settings provided? =

Perhaps you want to make the text of your testimonial italic or bold or you want to change the
margins of your testimonial. Simply find the specific css id tag of the testimonial on your page you wish to make changes to and add these css changes to your theme's custom css file. The easiest way to find the specific css id selector for the testimonial you want to change is by using the "developer" function of your browser or a browser extension such as [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com).
